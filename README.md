# HearMe
Hi There, This is HearMe!
HearMe is an open-sourced, collaborative, alternative to Vent.
The code has been primarily written in Rust.

HearMe can be traced back to Aiden (SnakeOverflow) and Florence (Nephilim, Neuroticneph)
HearMe is a tool designed to be like peer support like a reference or a tool for mental health.
HearMe should not be used as a replacement for mental health treatment!
And HearMe is not designed to cure or treat anything in particular.

Thank you so much for being apart of our Journey.
